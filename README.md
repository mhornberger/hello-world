===========

first attempt at Github stuff

Okay, so I'm adding some text on this branch thingie.  Let's see how it works.  I'm not optimistic.  But when am I?

Here is a *fourth* version.  What do you think of that?  I'm wondering how well it would work if we had multiple people trying it?   How easy is it to get people to work on plain-text files?
